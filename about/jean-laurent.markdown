[Jean-Laurent de Morlhon](http://twitter.com/morlhon), I'm CTO at [Xebia Studio](http://studio.xebia.fr), have founded [Serpodile](http://serpodile.com) to help all the kids write easily and am an happy father of 4 kids. I write software for almost 15 years.

I love the act of writing software transforming a vague idea from the mind of someone, into an efficient software which really helps.

Writing software is often associated with bloat, bugs, late, unmaintainable code and crappy interface. 
I like challenging this idea, and thrive to convince people that there is another way of writing software.
For that matter I explore the software craftsmanship movement and built from the ground up the [Xebia Studio](http://studio.xebia.fr) where we write elegant software for client who care for quickness and quality.

I'm a tdd guy, and I host many [coderetreats](http://coderetreat.org/about), to meet clever developpers, learn new techniques, and just train.
