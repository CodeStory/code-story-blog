	<h1>FooBarQix code selection exercise</h1>
	<h3>16 Nov 2011</h3>
</div>
<div id="post"><h1 id='you_know_fizzbuzz_'>You know FizzBuzz ?</h1>

<p>To solve FizzBuzz kata, one should write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. One number per line. For multiples of 3 print &#8220;Fizz&#8221; instead of the number and for the multiples of 5 print &#8220;Buzz&#8221;. For multiples of both 3 and 5 print &#8220;FizzBuzz&#8221;.</p>

<h1 id='we_want_you_to_do_foobarqix_instead_'>We want you to do FooBarQix instead !</h1>

<p>Keep the same rules as above with a couple of changes. In this case, the number 3 becomes Foo, 5 becomes Bar, and 7 becomes Qix.</p>

<p>Your code must run in a jvm, if you&#8217;re doing fancy stuff explain us how to run your code. Just send an URL pointing to a public github repository and anything you want us to know about you to <a href='mailto:qualif@code-story.net'>qualif@code-story.net</a> before December 16th 2011.</p>

<p>Be inventive, be pragmatic, write beautiful code, impress us, show us you want to code with us.</p>

<p>We are eager to code with you soon.</p>
