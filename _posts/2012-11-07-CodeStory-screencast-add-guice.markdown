When some classes interact with each others then dependency injection may play a key role into keeping code clean and
fully testable.

Starting from [commit 398b5d2547](https://github.com/CodeStory/code-story-world/commit/398b5d2547b489336fa3f7d5771f49ff8219fdd7),
we have introduced [Google Guice](http://code.google.com/p/google-guice) into our [planning application](http://fight.code-story.net/planning.html).
We use it with Jersey because it is well integrated.

This screencast shows why and how we started usinging it.
