Yesterday we finished the [Devoxx session](http://devoxx.com/display/DV12/Code+Story) of Code-Story.

Our challenge was to develop [Code-Story Fight](http://fight.code-story.net), a website that allows users to create and share fights between two keywords(speaker, tag, subject), "a la" Google Fight. Then you get the scores based on what people liked the most at Devoxx.

Before the event we
hacked a [schedule website](http://planning.code-story.net) using our Code-Story standards :) in order to gather
votes for Devoxx talks. This data was leveraged by the [fight website](http://fight.code-story.net)
bootstrapped in front of the Devoxxians.

We did develop the website and did deploy it very quickly. Here are some stats:
 - 6 hours of coding
 - a website deployed from hour one
 - about 1300 votes by 70 people
 - more than 4000 hits on the fight application!
 - cool features like bookmarkable urls, *tweet this page*, css animations, Top Fights, etc...

This session was great and we hope that everybody enjoyed the show. Please fork
[our repository](https://github.com/CodeStory/code-story-fight): this is merely what we have done during this crazy two
days of live coding.
