We finished the [Devoxx session](http://devoxx.com/display/DV12/Code+Story) of Code-Story. Before the event we
hacked a [schedule web site](http://planning.code-story.net) using our Code-Story code standards :) in order to gather
votes for Devoxx talks. This data was used to develop the [fight web application](http://fight.code-story.net)
bootstrapped from scratch in front of all of Devoxxians.

[Code-Story Fight](http://fight.code-story.net) allows users to create and share fights between two keywords. Then you
get the scores based on what people like the most at Devoxx.

Here are some stats :
 - 6 hours of coding
 - a web site deployed from hour one
 - about 1200 votes by 70 people
 - more than 4000 hits on the fight application!
 - cool features like bookmarkable urls, *tweet this page*, css animations, top fights, etc...

This session was great and we hope that everybody enjoyed the show. Please checkout
[our repository](https://github.com/CodeStory/code-story-fight): this is merely what we have done during this crazy two
days of live coding.
