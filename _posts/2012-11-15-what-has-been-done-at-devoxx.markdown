We have finished the [Devoxx session of Code-Story](http://devoxx.com/display/DV12/Code+Story). Previously we have
hacked a [planning web app](http://planning.code-story.net) using our Code Story code standards :) in order to gather
some votes for Devoxx talks. This data has been used to develop the [fight web application](http://fight.code-story.net)
bootstrapped from scratch in front of all of Devoxxians.

[Code Story Fight](http://fight.code-story.net) allow users to create and share a fight between two keywords. Then you
get the scores based on what people like at Devoxx.

Here some stats :
 - 6 hours of code
 - one web application deployed starting for the first hour
 - about 1200 votes on 70 plannings
 - more than 4000 hits on fight application !
 - cool features like bookmarkable urls, *tweet this page*, css animations, top fights, etc.

This session was great and we hope that every body has enjoyed the show. Please checkout
[our repository](https://github.com/CodeStory/code-story-fight) : this is merely what we have done during this crazy two
days of live coding.
