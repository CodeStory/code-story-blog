We have recently deployed a new [planning application](http://fight.code-story.net/planning.html) which allow users to
star any [Devoxx World 2012](http://www.devoxx.com) talks they likes.

Although all code of this application is available [from github](https://github.com/CodeStory/code-story-world), we
think that a screencast may be useful to whet your appetite until
[our live coding at Devoxx](http://devoxx.com/display/DV12/Code+Story).

This is an explanation of [commit cfd7b5fbf5](https://github.com/CodeStory/code-story-world/commit/cfd7b5fbf56dd9c48e476bfa3a8bf1915b62de1d).
