title: FooBarQix code selection exercise
---

You know FizzBuzz ?
===================

To solve FizzBuzz kata, one should write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. One number per line. For multiples of 3 print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of 5 print "Buzz". For multiples of both 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz".

We want you to do FooBarQix instead !
=====================================

Keep the same rules as above with a couple of changes. In this case, the number 3 becomes Foo, 5 becomes Bar, and 7 becomes Qix.

Your code must run in a jvm. If you're doing fancy stuff explain us how to run your code. Just send an URL pointing to a public github repository and anything you want us to know about you to [qualif@code-story.net](mailto:qualif@code-story.net) before December 16th 2011.

Be inventive, be pragmatic, write beautiful code, impress us, show us you want to code with us.

We are eager to code with you soon.
