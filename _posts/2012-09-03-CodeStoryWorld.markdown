Last year, at Devoxx France, the CodeStory Team live-coded an [application](http://prod.code-story.net/index.html) from scratch, in front of the audience. (Parleys in french, [here](http://www.parleys.com/#st=5&id=3174&sl=0) and [here](http://www.parleys.com/#st=5&id=3179&sl=0))

Because we received an [amazing feedback](http://www.google.com/#hl=en&q=codestory+devoxx), we are back at Devoxx world, in english this time, with a new application.

You want real code, no slides, right? Same for us. During two days (wednesday and thursday), you’re going to participate to the development of an exciting application and discover great programming techniques.

We’ll breakdown the show in one hour long sessions, using visual feedback tools, making sure you understand what we’re doing.

Can't wait to meeting you there, and stay tune for the preparation of the show might keep you interested too!
