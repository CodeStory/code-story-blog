Hello, I'm [Xavier Hanin](http://twitter.com/xavierhanin), and I am dev-aholic.

It's been a while now, I've written my first for loop in BASIC on a thompson MO5 when I was 10, moved to C when I was 17, code in Java since 1997 and JS since 2006. 

I'm working for [4SH](http://4sh.fr/), where I've founded the Java and Web development team in Bordeaux in 2008. Together with a team of 15 talented and passionated people, we help software editors to face their challenges.

Besides my job, I created [Apache Ivy](http://ant.apache.org/ivy) in 2004 and lead it to the ASF in 2006. This experience has been tremendous, it lead me to famous places like the Stanford University, EMC2 labs, SAS headquarters or LinkedIn. I've also been a speaker at a few european conferences, I have founded the [BordeauxJUG](http://bordeauxjug.org/) in 2008, and I'm teaching at [ENSEIRB MATMECA](http://www.enseirb-matmeca.fr) since 10 years.
